# Online-Shoppers-Purchasing-Intention
Lauk Fresh is a B2C e-grocery startup that provides groceries products online. We came up by seeing the great potential of e-grocery data to produce a 36% increase in CR (2020 vs 2021) and of course, we can use this to generate profits through increased conversion rates. Moreover, a phenomenon that has emerged recently is the Start-up bubble with one of the causes: too much dependence on investors. So we need to think about how to make our e-commerce ecosystem profitable and survive in the rampant competition.
